# spawnpoint

An opinionated starter template for your rails projects, based on
our experience and requirements at [Impraise](http://www.impraise.com)

### Starting a new project with this template:

1. Start a new project, specifying a link to this template using the `-m` option

  ```shell
  $ rails new coolproject -m https://raw.github.com/impraise/spawnpoint/master/spawnpoint.rb
  ```

2. Grab a cup of coffee while everything is set up
3. You're good to go!

### Testing

(Temporary) - A `Makefile` is included with a simple shortcut to test the template
by creating a new project under `build/`, simply run:

```shell
$ make
```
